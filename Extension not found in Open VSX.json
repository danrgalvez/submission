Try disabling other extensions one by one to see if the issue resolves.\n\n4. **Verify Database Connection:**\n   - Make sure that your database connection is properly configured and that you have the necessary permissions to access the tags. Check the connection settings in the extension and ensure that they are correct.\n\n5. **Inspect Logs and Output:**\n   - Open the Output panel in VS Code and select the MySQL client extension from the dropdown. Look for any error messages or warnings that might give you a clue about what is going wrong.\n\n6. **Check for Known Issues:**\n   - Visit the GitHub repository of the extension to see if there are any known issues related to the display of tags. You can find the repository link on the extension's page in the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX.\n\n7. **Reinstall the Extension:**\n   - If the issue persists, try uninstalling and then reinstalling the extension.

This issue could be related to how the tags are being processed or displayed in your editor or database.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Input Format:**\n   - Ensure that you are entering the tags in the correct format. Tags are often expected to be comma-separated or space-separated strings. Verify the expected format in the documentation or settings of your MySQL client extension.\n\n2. **Inspect the Database Schema:**\n   - Verify that the database schema for the tags column is correctly set up. It should typically be a text or varchar type, and not a type that would cause individual characters to be encircled.\n\n3. **Review the Article Creation Code:**\n   - If you are using a script or application to create the article, review the code to ensure that the tags are being processed and inserted correctly. Look for any string manipulation that might be causing the issue.\n\n4. **Check the Encoding:**\n   - Ensure that the text encoding is consistent and appropriate for your database and application. Mismatched encodings can sometimes cause display issues.\n\n5. **Inspect the Output:**\n   - Look at the raw HTML or text output of the article to see how the tags are being rendered. This can help you identify if the issue is happening during the data entry or display phase.\n\n6. **Use a Different Client:**\n   - Try using a different MySQL client or database management tool to create and view the article. This can help you determine if the issue is specific to the `cweijan.vscode-mysql-client2` extension.\n\n7. **Sanitize Input:**\n   - Ensure that any input sanitization or escaping is not causing the issue. Sometimes, overly aggressive sanitization can lead to unexpected formatting.\n\n8. **Example Code:**\n   - If possible, provide a sample of the code or SQL query you are using to create the article with tags. This can help identify any potential issues in the code.\n\nHere is an example of how you might insert tags correctly in SQL:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO articles (title, content, tags) VALUES ('My Article', 'This is the content of my article.', 'tag1,tag2,tag3');\n```\n\nAnd here's how you might handle it in a script:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\n# Connect to the database\nconn = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host=\"localhost\",\n    user=\"yourusername\",\n    password=\"yourpassword\",\n    database=\"yourdatabase\"\n)\n\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Prepare the SQL query\nsql = \"INSERT INTO articles (title, content, tags) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\"\nval = (\"My Article\", \"This is the content of my article.\", \"tag1,tag2,tag3\")\n\n# Execute the query\ncursor.execute(sql, val)\n\n# Commit the transaction\nconn.commit()\n\nprint(cursor.rowcount, \"record inserted.\")\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nIf you can provide more details about how you are creating the article and the specific format of the tags, I can offer more targeted advice."}]}
